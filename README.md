Java is one of the most popular programming languages around, but no one seems
to enjoy using it. Well, Java is actually an alright programming language, and
since Java 8 came out recently, I decided to compile a list of libraries,
practices, and tools to make using Java better. "Better" is subjective, so I
would recommend taking the parts that speak to you and use them, rather than
trying to use all of them at once. Feel free to submit pull requests
suggesting additions.

Java是世上最流行的编程语言之一，可是看起来没人喜欢它。但其实Java是一门很合心意的编程语言，最近随着Java 8的发布，我决定祭出一份实用库、最佳实践和工具列表，让Java用起来更爽。当然“更爽”是我的主观感觉，所以我建议你能够尝试使用我所说的这些部分，而不是一次性地使用所有的东西。随时提交pull requests、建议和补充。
